# Tic Tac Toe exercise for the Odin Project

On [my implementation](https://paposeco.github.io/tictactoe/) you can play against another person or against the computer.

## Requirements

At least one human must play, and you can play against the computer with X or with O. The humans are always prompted for their name; if not provided the default is Player X or Player O.

## Computer

I did my best to implement an algorithm that makes it so you can't win the computer. If the computer can't win, it will try to get a tie.
It was suggested on the exercise that we should take a look at the minimax algorithm. My implementation is roughly based on it, but it's not exactly the same. From what I've seen my implementation is probably a lot slower and might be incomplete. I wish there was a way to test my algorithm so that I could be sure it is fail proof.

## Final thoughts

It took me 23 days to get this to work. :flushed: I made a million tiny mistakes that were very hard to identify. I also fell into the trap of poorly naming variables and functions which only made the matter worse.
However I'm glad I didn't give up and I weirdly feel a sense of pride every time the computer wins. It's the little things.

If you play and manage to win the Computer let me know!
